      Industries to be impacted by the coronavirus
Which industry is the most likely to undergo dramatic changes after the pandemic?
The coronavirus is forcing people around the world to refrain from certain activities in the coming years.



Hosting business where many people work in an enclosed indoor space.

Large-scale events during which thousands of people gather in ample indoor or outdoor areas.

Business or overseas trips that involve traveling around countries.



Businesses related to activities with the potential risk of infection are expected to suffer severe downturns [1].



Businesses in enclosed space: Large cinemas, performing arts theaters that stage things like operas and musicals, art galleries and other exhibition-related industries, restaurants, pubs, offline distribution outlets, offline training facilities, beauty shops, and indoor sports such as gyms and yoga studios are all at the verge of a downturn.

The event industry that gathers thousands of people: Stadium sports such as baseball and football, large-scale outdoor performing arts including concerts, industry conference, theme parks, and big festivals (e.g., Oktoberfest) will slow.

Industries based on inter-country mobility: the aviation industry, airports, duty-free shops, the on- and offline booking industry (airline ticketing, hotel and rental car booking, etc.), as well as the travel industry will be impacted all the way through the tail-end of the pandemic.



Some industries will probably be reshaped. By providing satisfying levels of service during the pandemic, online alternatives are redesigning the landscapes of these industries.



Film industry: The multiplex cinema appears to find it difficult to rebound after the pandemic. OTT (Over The Top Service) [2] operators such as Netflix provide quality service at an agreeable price. At the same time, the household penetration rate of 50-inch or bigger TVs and other home theater equipment keeps increasing. Netflix has charmed consumers to think it's more convenient to watch Netflix at home than to go to a cinema (unless the movie in question is a long-awaited blockbuster). Moreover, at a monthly membership rate equivalent to a single trip to a theater, the Netflix service is available on multiple devices, from TV, laptop, desktop PC, to mobile.

Travel-related business: With the recent push for social distancing and self-isolation, telecommuting and remote collaboration tools such as Zoom and Slack have made people notice the efficiency and productivity of video meetings over offline meetings. Companies note that unless complex interests and issues are entangled, online is a superior platform both in terms of cost and time. Big tech companies such as Google and Facebook are jumping into the online collaboration tool market by launching new video meeting tools and strengthening investments in VR/AR technology [3]. The online collaboration platforms are gaining footholds while offline meetings steadily decrease. Long-range business trips that require hours of plane travel seem to be less frequent than before. Industries related to airlines, ticketing, accommodations, etc. also appear to suffer a huge blow.

Large-scale performing arts: Massive indoor and outdoor performing arts such as operas, musicals, and concerts have had to be canceled or postponed. Artists and entertainment companies around the world are developing creative ways to cope: live-streaming or online collaborations over various streaming services and social platforms. Beyond Live, an online platform for exclusive live concerts is hosted by NAVER, the number-one portal in Korea, and SM Entertainment, one of Korea's most extensive entertainment companies. Its first show, featuring the K-pop group SuperM, drew 75,000 viewers, each of whom paid 33,000 won, from 109 countries. The 120-minute show, tagged with live chat functions using AR technology, generated about 2.4 billion won in profits. Although online shows may not replace large-scale performances entirely any time soon, the surge of online performances that use various cutting-edge technologies is an irreversible trend. Beyond Live is creating a new environment where people watch highly satisfying performances at a lower cost than ever before.

Small and medium-size offline grocery stores: Self-isolation has also brought up the use of online and mobile commerce such as Amazon or Instacart in the U.S., and Coupang and Market Kurly in Korea. As more consumers continue to use online options instead of visiting offline grocery stores or retail shops, the shift of power in the distribution industry from offline to online becomes more pronounced. In Korea, both Coupang and Market Kurly customers' satisfaction in products, delivery, price, and customer service is found to be higher than that of traditional distribution channels. Customers in their 50s and 60s who have opted to use offline outlets are now churning [4] to shop online. The offline retailers' business base seems to have been greatly shaken.

Offline education and training industries: Because of the pandemic, primary, secondary, and university education in major countries have been substituted by Zoom-based video education, expediting the advancement of online platforms in education, which has traditionally been heavily offline-based. In particular, with the development of video communications software and the improvement of technologies such as natural language processing, AI, and machine learning, high-quality online education platforms that incorporate various software and technologies are rapidly emerging. Many from the increasing number of users who have experienced quality online education services during self-isolation are saying that they want to continue to learn through online or mobile platforms rather than offline programs.
